### Notes:
- Map In Dart (Hash Map ---- Linked Hash Map ---- Splay Tree Map) 
- Hash Map (Not Ordered) -- Hash Table (Ordered)
- Hash Table 
A Hash table is defined as a data structure used to insert, look up, and remove key-value pairs quickly.
It operates on the hashing concept,
where each key is translated by a hash function into a distinct index in an array.
  The index functions as a storage location for the matching value.
In simple words, it maps the keys with the value.
